                I am a Computer Science student at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT), Pune, deeply passionate about technology, innovation, and creating meaningful solutions. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and the fundamentals of computer science. Alongside my coursework, I’ve explored emerging domains such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, where I’ve developed a keen interest in applying these technologies to real-world problems.

                Beyond the classroom, I actively engage in coding competitions, hackathons, and tech club activities that allow me to continuously challenge myself and collaborate with like-minded peers. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical skills but also nurtured a mindset geared toward critical thinking, teamwork, and creativity. I enjoy working on hands-on projects that have a real-world impact, whether it's building smart systems, optimizing existing solutions, or exploring new ideas through experimentation.

                I am driven by curiosity and a desire to contribute to the tech industry by developing solutions that improve lives and drive progress. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges. I look forward to connecting with professionals and organizations that share a similar vision of innovation and impact, and I’m excited about opportunities where I can bring my passion, skills, and dedication to the table.
